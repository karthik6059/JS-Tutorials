| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional**                   | - Does the feature do what it’s supposed to?<br>- Are all user actions (happy & alternate paths) covered?<br>- What happens if steps are done in a different order?                                | Ensure core functionality works correctly           |
| **Negative / Error Handling**    | - What if inputs are invalid or missing?<br>- Are error messages meaningful?<br>- What happens if limits are exceeded?<br>- Can users break the system with unexpected actions?                    | Test system resilience & robustness                 |
| **Boundary / Edge Cases**        | - What are the minimum/maximum values?<br>- How does system behave at edge conditions?<br>- Are unusual inputs handled?<br>- Are time-based limits enforced?                                       | Catch bugs at the edges of allowed input/conditions |
| **Security**                     | - Can unauthorized users access this?<br>- Are inputs validated/sanitized?<br>- Is sensitive data secure?<br>- Can steps be bypassed or old data reused?<br>- Are brute force/rate limits applied? | Protect system & data from attacks                  |
| **Integration / Dependencies**   | - Which systems or APIs does this depend on?<br>- What if an external system fails?<br>- Are data updates consistent?<br>- Are logs/notifications generated correctly?                             | Ensure end-to-end correctness with other systems    |
| **Performance / Load**           | - How does it behave under normal & peak load?<br>- Are response times acceptable?<br>- Are there resource bottlenecks or memory issues?                                                           | Verify scalability, speed, and reliability          |
| **Usability / UX**               | - Is the interface clear & intuitive?<br>- Are instructions and error messages understandable?<br>- Can users recover from mistakes easily?<br>- Are accessibility standards followed?             | Improve user experience and reduce errors           |
| **Regression / Maintainability** | - Will changes break other areas?<br>- Are dependencies stable?<br>- Can tests be automated for future regression?<br>- Are there reusable patterns?                                               | Ensure long-term stability and reduce rework        |
