Exercise 3: Design complete test cases for 'Password Reset with OTP' considering functional,negative, boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects.Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios -Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness
Solution:
1. Inputs and Rules Identification
Inputs:
•	Registered email / mobile number
•	OTP (One-Time Password)
•	New password
•	Confirm password
Rules / Business Logic:
1.	OTP is valid for a limited time (e.g., 5 minutes).
2.	OTP is a fixed length (typically 6 digits).
3.	Password must meet complexity rules (e.g., min 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character).
4.	Email/mobile must be registered.
5.	Password and confirm password must match.
6.	User cannot reuse last N passwords.
7.	OTP attempts limit (e.g., 3 attempts per request).
ID	Test Scenario	Category	Description / Key Points
TS01	Request OTP	Functional	User requests OTP for registered email/phone; verify OTP sent successfully
TS02	Enter correct OTP	Functional	User enters valid OTP within expiry; should proceed to reset password
TS03	Enter incorrect OTP	Negative	Invalid OTP entry; system should display error
TS04	OTP expiry	Boundary / Negative	OTP used after expiry; system rejects OTP
TS05	OTP resend	Functional / Boundary	Resend OTP; old OTP invalidated; verify resend limits
TS06	Password reset with valid password	Functional	New password meets complexity; reset successful
TS07	Password and confirm mismatch	Negative	System should show error for mismatch
TS08	Weak password entry	Negative / Boundary	Password not meeting rules; system rejects
TS09	Minimum password length	Boundary	Password at minimum length accepted
TS10	Maximum password length	Boundary	Password at max allowed length accepted
TS11	Reuse old password	Negative / Security	System prevents reuse of previous password
TS12	Request OTP for unregistered user	Negative	Error displayed; OTP not sent
TS13	Maximum OTP attempts exceeded	Security	System blocks OTP after allowed attempts
TS14	SQL Injection / XSS attacks	Security	Input fields are sanitized; no DB compromise
TS15	OTP transmission via email/SMS	Integration	Verify OTP delivery via email/SMS gateway
TS16	Password change reflects in login	Integration	User can login with new password; DB updated correctly
TS17	High concurrent OTP requests	Performance	System handles peak load without errors
TS18	OTP verification under load	Performance	System validates OTPs correctly under load
TS19	Session / link security	Security / Integration	Password reset link valid only for authorized user/session
TS20	Regression scenarios	Regression	Ensure existing OTP and password rules still work after changes

Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness

✅ 1. Identify Inputs & Business Rules
Inputs

Product ID (SKU)

Quantity

Product options (size, color, variant)

User type (Guest / Logged-in)

Stock availability

Price (base price, discount, tax)

Promo code (if auto-applied)

Cart session ID
