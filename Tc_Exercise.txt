Exercise 1: Design complete test cases for 'Login System' considering functional, negative, boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects. Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios - Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness
Solution:
1️⃣ Assumptions & Input Rules
Input Fields:
•	Username / Email
•	Password
•	Remember Me (checkbox)
•	Login Button
•	Forgot Password link
•	CAPTCHA (after N failed attempts)
Business Rules:
•	Username: 3–50 characters (alphanumeric + allowed special chars)
•	Password: 8–20 characters
•	Account locks after 5 failed attempts
•	Session timeout: 15 minutes of inactivity
•	Password stored encrypted
•	HTTPS enforced
Test Type	Coverage Area	Key Scenarios Covered
Functional Testing	Core system behavior	Valid login, email login, Remember Me, Forgot password, Logout, Session timeout, CAPTCHA trigger
Negative Testing	Invalid inputs & error handling	Empty fields, wrong password, unregistered user, locked account, expired password
Boundary Testing	Input limits validation	Username (3–50 chars), Password (8–20 chars), Login attempt threshold (5 attempts)
Security Testing	Protection against vulnerabilities	SQL injection, XSS, brute force, HTTPS enforcement, session fixation, CSRF, token tampering, password hashing
Integration Testing	External system interaction	Database validation, Email service, LDAP/SSO, CAPTCHA service, Audit logging
Performance Testing	Load & stress behavior	1,000 concurrent users, 5,000 peak load, API stress test, DB performance
Failure & Edge Cases	System stability	DB down, Email server down, Network interruption, Expired session, Multiple device login
Regression Areas	Re-validation after changes	Login flow, Lock logic, Timeout, Encryption, CAPTCHA, Remember Me, Browser compatibility
Automation Readiness	Suitable for automation	Login validation, Boundary tests, Lockout logic, Session timeout, API response checks

 
Exercise 2: Design complete test cases for 'User Registration' considering functional, negative,boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects.Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios -Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness
Solution:
1️⃣ Assumptions & Business Rules
Fields
•	First Name (Required, 2–50 chars, alphabets + hyphen allowed)
•	Last Name (Required, 2–50 chars)
•	Email (Required, valid format, unique)
•	Password (Required, 8–20 chars)
•	Confirm Password (Must match)
•	Phone (Optional, 10–15 digits)
•	Date of Birth (Optional, age ≥ 13)
•	Accept Terms (Mandatory checkbox)
Password Rules
•	At least 1 uppercase
•	At least 1 lowercase
•	At least 1 number
•	At least 1 special character
Category	Test Scenario	Description / Key Points
Functional	Successful Registration	All mandatory fields valid → account created
	Mandatory Field Validation	Leave required fields blank → error shown
	Email Format Validation	Invalid email → error shown
	Password Complexity	Password missing criteria → blocked
	Confirm Password Mismatch	Password ≠ Confirm Password → error
	Unique Email Check	Duplicate email → error
	Terms Not Accepted	Registration blocked if checkbox unchecked
	Optional Fields Blank	Registration still successful
Boundary	Field Length Validation	First/Last Name, Password, etc., min & max limits
	Age Limit	DOB validation (≥13 years)
Negative	Blank Submission	All fields blank → errors
	Invalid Characters	Special chars in name → error
	Injection Attacks	SQL/XSS → blocked / sanitized
	Network / Timeout Failures	Proper error handling & rollback
	Duplicate Submission	Prevent double registration
	Excessively Long Inputs	Inputs > expected length → rejected
Security	Password Storage	Stored encrypted (hash + salt)
	HTTPS Enforcement	Data transmitted securely
	Brute Force / Rate Limit	Limit repeated attempts
	CSRF / XSS	Requests blocked / sanitized
	API Payload Tampering	Server-side validation enforced
Integration	Email Service	Verification email sent
	Database	User data stored correctly
	CRM / Analytics / SSO	Data synced & events logged
	SMS Gateway	OTP sent (if applicable)
Performance	Response Time	Single registration < 2s
	Load / Stress / Spike Test	System handles concurrent registrations
	Database Load	No deadlocks or failures
Regression	Admin User Management	Admin sees/edits new users correctly
	Login / Password Reset	Works for new registered users
	Role & Permissions	Default role assignment validated
	Reports / Analytics	User metrics accurate
