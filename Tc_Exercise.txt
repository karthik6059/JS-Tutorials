Exercise 3: Design complete test cases for 'Password Reset with OTP' considering functional,negative, boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects.Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios -Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness
Solution:
1. Inputs and Rules Identification
Inputs:
•	Registered email / mobile number
•	OTP (One-Time Password)
•	New password
•	Confirm password
Rules / Business Logic:
1.	OTP is valid for a limited time (e.g., 5 minutes).
2.	OTP is a fixed length (typically 6 digits).
3.	Password must meet complexity rules (e.g., min 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character).
4.	Email/mobile must be registered.
5.	Password and confirm password must match.
6.	User cannot reuse last N passwords.
7.	OTP attempts limit (e.g., 3 attempts per request).
ID	Test Scenario	Category	Description / Key Points
TS01	Request OTP	Functional	User requests OTP for registered email/phone; verify OTP sent successfully
TS02	Enter correct OTP	Functional	User enters valid OTP within expiry; should proceed to reset password
TS03	Enter incorrect OTP	Negative	Invalid OTP entry; system should display error
TS04	OTP expiry	Boundary / Negative	OTP used after expiry; system rejects OTP
TS05	OTP resend	Functional / Boundary	Resend OTP; old OTP invalidated; verify resend limits
TS06	Password reset with valid password	Functional	New password meets complexity; reset successful
TS07	Password and confirm mismatch	Negative	System should show error for mismatch
TS08	Weak password entry	Negative / Boundary	Password not meeting rules; system rejects
TS09	Minimum password length	Boundary	Password at minimum length accepted
TS10	Maximum password length	Boundary	Password at max allowed length accepted
TS11	Reuse old password	Negative / Security	System prevents reuse of previous password
TS12	Request OTP for unregistered user	Negative	Error displayed; OTP not sent
TS13	Maximum OTP attempts exceeded	Security	System blocks OTP after allowed attempts
TS14	SQL Injection / XSS attacks	Security	Input fields are sanitized; no DB compromise
TS15	OTP transmission via email/SMS	Integration	Verify OTP delivery via email/SMS gateway
TS16	Password change reflects in login	Integration	User can login with new password; DB updated correctly
TS17	High concurrent OTP requests	Performance	System handles peak load without errors
TS18	OTP verification under load	Performance	System validates OTPs correctly under load
TS19	Session / link security	Security / Integration	Password reset link valid only for authorized user/session
TS20	Regression scenarios	Regression	Ensure existing OTP and password rules still work after changes

✅ 1. Identify Inputs & Business Rules
Inputs

Product ID (SKU)

Quantity

Product options (size, color, variant)

User type (Guest / Logged-in)

Stock availability

Price (base price, discount, tax)

Promo code (if auto-applied)

Cart session ID

Exercise 8: Design complete test cases for 'Order Cancellation' considering functional, negative, boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects. Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios - Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness cretae dummy dummy business requirments also

Dummy Business Requirements for Order Cancellation

BR1: A customer can cancel an order if the order status is “Pending” or “Processing”.

BR2: Orders with status “Shipped” or “Delivered” cannot be canceled.

BR3: Cancelling an order should refund the amount to the original payment method.

BR4: The system must send a confirmation email and SMS to the customer upon successful cancellation.

BR5: Only the order owner or admin can cancel the order.

BR6: The system should log all cancellations for auditing purposes.

BR7: If multiple orders are being canceled concurrently, system performance should not degrade beyond 2 seconds per transaction.

BR8: System should handle network failures gracefully and retry cancellation up to 3 times before failure.

| **Boundary**                  | Order limits & time restrictions       | Cancel at exact allowed time; cancel after cutoff; minimum and maximum items per order; large volume orders                                     |

| **Performance / Concurrency** | System response under load             | Single order response <2s; bulk/concurrent order cancellations ≤2s per order; retry handling on network failure; mixed order actions under load |

Dummy Business Requirements for Loan Application

BR1: Customers can apply for loans if they are 18 years or older and have a valid account.

BR2: Maximum loan amount is $500,000; minimum is $1,000.

BR3: Interest rates depend on loan type (personal, home, auto) and customer credit score.

BR4: Customer must submit valid documents (ID proof, income proof, address proof).

BR5: Loan application status can be “Pending”, “Approved”, or “Rejected”.

BR6: Only authenticated users can submit loan applications.

BR7: Loan approval requires credit score verification and income validation.

BR8: Notifications (email/SMS) are sent on submission, approval, or rejection.

BR9: System should prevent duplicate applications for the same loan type within 30 days.

BR10: System should handle multiple concurrent loan applications efficiently.

Exercise 14: Design complete test cases for 'Admin Dashboard Filters' considering functional, negative, boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects. Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios - Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness with sample business reuqirents

Sample Business Requirement

The Admin Dashboard allows administrators to filter user or transaction data with the following features:

Filters available: Date Range, Status (Active/Inactive/Suspended), Role (Admin/User/Manager), Department, Transaction Amount Range.

Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously.

Results are displayed in a paginated table with sorting options.

Dashboard should handle thousands of records efficiently.

Only authorized admins can access the dashboard.

Export functionality available for filtered results.

Exercise 15: Design complete test cases for 'Role-Based Access Control' considering functional,
negative, boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects.
Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios -
Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness

Sample Business Requirement

The system implements Role-Based Access Control for users:

Roles: Admin, Manager, User, Guest

Permissions:

Admin: Full access (create, read, update, delete users, settings, data)

Manager: Limited administrative access (view reports, manage assigned teams)

User: Access own data, limited operations

Guest: Read-only public content

Users can have multiple roles.

Access control applies across all modules: Dashboard, Reports, File Uploads, Settings.

Unauthorized actions must be blocked and logged.
