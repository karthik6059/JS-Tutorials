Exercise 1: Design complete test cases for 'Login System' considering functional, negative, boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects. Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios - Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness
Solution:
1️⃣ Assumptions & Input Rules
Input Fields:
•	Username / Email
•	Password
•	Remember Me (checkbox)
•	Login Button
•	Forgot Password link
•	CAPTCHA (after N failed attempts)
Business Rules:
•	Username: 3–50 characters (alphanumeric + allowed special chars)
•	Password: 8–20 characters
•	Account locks after 5 failed attempts
•	Session timeout: 15 minutes of inactivity
•	Password stored encrypted
•	HTTPS enforced
Test Type	Coverage Area	Key Scenarios Covered
Functional Testing	Core system behavior	Valid login, email login, Remember Me, Forgot password, Logout, Session timeout, CAPTCHA trigger
Negative Testing	Invalid inputs & error handling	Empty fields, wrong password, unregistered user, locked account, expired password
Boundary Testing	Input limits validation	Username (3–50 chars), Password (8–20 chars), Login attempt threshold (5 attempts)
Security Testing	Protection against vulnerabilities	SQL injection, XSS, brute force, HTTPS enforcement, session fixation, CSRF, token tampering, password hashing
Integration Testing	External system interaction	Database validation, Email service, LDAP/SSO, CAPTCHA service, Audit logging
Performance Testing	Load & stress behavior	1,000 concurrent users, 5,000 peak load, API stress test, DB performance
Failure & Edge Cases	System stability	DB down, Email server down, Network interruption, Expired session, Multiple device login
Regression Areas	Re-validation after changes	Login flow, Lock logic, Timeout, Encryption, CAPTCHA, Remember Me, Browser compatibility
Automation Readiness	Suitable for automation	Login validation, Boundary tests, Lockout logic, Session timeout, API response checks

Exercise 2: Design complete test cases for 'User Registration' considering functional, negative,boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects.Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios -Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness
Solution:
1️⃣ Assumptions & Business Rules
Fields
•	First Name (Required, 2–50 chars, alphabets + hyphen allowed)
•	Last Name (Required, 2–50 chars)
•	Email (Required, valid format, unique)
•	Password (Required, 8–20 chars)
•	Confirm Password (Must match)
•	Phone (Optional, 10–15 digits)
•	Date of Birth (Optional, age ≥ 13)
•	Accept Terms (Mandatory checkbox)
Password Rules
•	At least 1 uppercase
•	At least 1 lowercase
•	At least 1 number
•	At least 1 special character
Category	Test Scenario	Description / Key Points
Functional	Successful Registration	All mandatory fields valid → account created
	Mandatory Field Validation	Leave required fields blank → error shown
	Email Format Validation	Invalid email → error shown
	Password Complexity	Password missing criteria → blocked
	Confirm Password Mismatch	Password ≠ Confirm Password → error
	Unique Email Check	Duplicate email → error
	Terms Not Accepted	Registration blocked if checkbox unchecked
	Optional Fields Blank	Registration still successful
Boundary	Field Length Validation	First/Last Name, Password, etc., min & max limits
	Age Limit	DOB validation (≥13 years)
Negative	Blank Submission	All fields blank → errors
	Invalid Characters	Special chars in name → error
	Injection Attacks	SQL/XSS → blocked / sanitized
	Network / Timeout Failures	Proper error handling & rollback
	Duplicate Submission	Prevent double registration
	Excessively Long Inputs	Inputs > expected length → rejected
Security	Password Storage	Stored encrypted (hash + salt)
	HTTPS Enforcement	Data transmitted securely
	Brute Force / Rate Limit	Limit repeated attempts
	CSRF / XSS	Requests blocked / sanitized
	API Payload Tampering	Server-side validation enforced
Integration	Email Service	Verification email sent
	Database	User data stored correctly
	CRM / Analytics / SSO	Data synced & events logged
	SMS Gateway	OTP sent (if applicable)
Performance	Response Time	Single registration < 2s
	Load / Stress / Spike Test	System handles concurrent registrations
	Database Load	No deadlocks or failures
Regression	Admin User Management	Admin sees/edits new users correctly
	Login / Password Reset	Works for new registered users
	Role & Permissions	Default role assignment validated
	Reports / Analytics	User metrics accurate

Exercise 3: Design complete test cases for 'Password Reset with OTP' considering functional,negative, boundary, security, integration, and performance aspects.Guidance: - Identify inputs and rules - Apply boundary conditions - Consider failure scenarios -Think about integration impact - Include regression areas - Consider automation readiness
Solution:
1. Inputs and Rules Identification
Inputs:
•	Registered email / mobile number
•	OTP (One-Time Password)
•	New password
•	Confirm password
Rules / Business Logic:
1.	OTP is valid for a limited time (e.g., 5 minutes).
2.	OTP is a fixed length (typically 6 digits).
3.	Password must meet complexity rules (e.g., min 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character).
4.	Email/mobile must be registered.
5.	Password and confirm password must match.
6.	User cannot reuse last N passwords.
7.	OTP attempts limit (e.g., 3 attempts per request).
ID	Test Scenario	Category	Description / Key Points
TS01	Request OTP	Functional	User requests OTP for registered email/phone; verify OTP sent successfully
TS02	Enter correct OTP	Functional	User enters valid OTP within expiry; should proceed to reset password
TS03	Enter incorrect OTP	Negative	Invalid OTP entry; system should display error
TS04	OTP expiry	Boundary / Negative	OTP used after expiry; system rejects OTP
TS05	OTP resend	Functional / Boundary	Resend OTP; old OTP invalidated; verify resend limits
TS06	Password reset with valid password	Functional	New password meets complexity; reset successful
TS07	Password and confirm mismatch	Negative	System should show error for mismatch
TS08	Weak password entry	Negative / Boundary	Password not meeting rules; system rejects
TS09	Minimum password length	Boundary	Password at minimum length accepted
TS10	Maximum password length	Boundary	Password at max allowed length accepted
TS11	Reuse old password	Negative / Security	System prevents reuse of previous password
TS12	Request OTP for unregistered user	Negative	Error displayed; OTP not sent
TS13	Maximum OTP attempts exceeded	Security	System blocks OTP after allowed attempts
TS14	SQL Injection / XSS attacks	Security	Input fields are sanitized; no DB compromise
TS15	OTP transmission via email/SMS	Integration	Verify OTP delivery via email/SMS gateway
TS16	Password change reflects in login	Integration	User can login with new password; DB updated correctly
TS17	High concurrent OTP requests	Performance	System handles peak load without errors
TS18	OTP verification under load	Performance	System validates OTPs correctly under load
TS19	Session / link security	Security / Integration	Password reset link valid only for authorized user/session
TS20	Regression scenarios	Regression	Ensure existing OTP and password rules still work after changes
