📌 Combined Examples
1️⃣ Select distinct departments with salary filter
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;

2️⃣ Count employees in IT or HR
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('IT', 'HR');

3️⃣ Employees with salary between range
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;

4️⃣ Names starting with "J"
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'J%';

5️⃣ Multiple conditions
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT'
AND salary >= 60000
AND hire_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-01-01';

SQL logical query processing order

| Step | Clause                 | What Happens                      | Notes                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `FROM`                 | Tables are identified and joined  | Includes `JOIN` conditions                     |
| 2    | `WHERE`                | Rows are filtered                 | Cannot use aggregate functions here            |
| 3    | `GROUP BY`             | Rows are grouped                  | Required before using aggregates (if grouping) |
| 4    | `HAVING`               | Groups are filtered               | Works on aggregated results                    |
| 5    | `SELECT`               | Columns are selected              | Expressions are evaluated here                 |
| 6    | `DISTINCT`             | Duplicate rows removed            | Applied after SELECT                           |
| 7    | `ORDER BY`             | Result is sorted                  | Final step before output                       |
| 8    | `LIMIT / TOP / OFFSET` | Restricts number of rows returned | Database-specific syntax                       |
